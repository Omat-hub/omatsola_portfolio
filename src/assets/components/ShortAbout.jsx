          Frontend developer and UI designer focused on crafting
          high-performance, user-centered web interfaces. With a strong grasp of
          design principles and modern frontend technologies, I build
          responsive, accessible, and visually polished digital experiences. I
          bridge the gap between design and development, delivering solutions
          that are both technically sound and thoughtfully designed for
          usability and impact.
